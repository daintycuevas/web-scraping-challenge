# web-scraping-challenge

Status of web scraping project is currently incomplete. HTML file is incomplete as web scraping button is unable to run. 

Initial step completed with jupyter notebook to scrape information from different NASA web pages. Featured image url worked during first few attempts, though following attempts web page did not load. Omitted for the time being to continue with following steps. 

The file scrape_mars.py was then created and transform results into a dictionary. 

Then, app.py was created for page routes and returning web scraping to pymongo. 

HTML under construction...
